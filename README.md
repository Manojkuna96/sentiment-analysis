Sentiment Analysis Project

Description:
This project is focused on performing sentiment analysis on textual data. 
The primary goal is to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral 
sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and EDA. 
The analysis can be useful for applications like social media monitoring, 
customer feedback analysis, or any context requiring sentiment insights.

Features:
Preprocessing textual data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization).
Building a machine learning model for sentiment classification.
Visualizing results using graphs and charts.
Supporting reproducibility with a Jupyter notebook.


Requirements:
Python: Version 3.7 or later.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
nltk/spacy: For text preprocessing (if applicable).

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Jupyter Notebook: For coding and documenting the analysis.
Natural Language Processing: Text processing techniques for feature extraction.
